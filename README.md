### Original

> Is it getting better
> Or do you feel the same?
> Will it make it easier on you, now
> You got someone to blame?
>
> You say one love, one life
> When it's one need in the night
> One love, we get to share it
> Leaves you, baby, if you don't care for it
>
>Did I disappoint you
> Or leave a bad taste in your mouth?
> You act like you never had love
> And you want me to go without
>
>Well, it's too late tonight
> To drag the past out into the light
> We're one, but we're not the same
> We get to carry each other, carry each other
> One
>
>Have you come here for forgiveness?
> Have you come to raise the dead?
> Have you come here to play Jesus
> To the lepers in your head?
>
>Did I ask too much? More than a lot
> You gave me nothing, now it's all I got
> We're one, but we're not the same
> Well, we hurt each other, then we do it again
>
>You say love is a temple, love a higher law
> Love is a temple, love the higher law
> You ask me to enter, but then you make me crawl
> And I can't be holding on to what you got
> When all you got is hurt
>
>One love, one blood
> One life, you got to do what you should
> One life with each other
> Sisters, brothers
> One life, but we're not the same
> We get to carry each other, carry each other
> One
> One
>

> Oh-ooh
> May we, may we, may we get

### Rewritten Lyrics

> Hey there, friends! Or should I say, one love, one life? Because apparently, according to this song, that's all we
> need! Yeah right, tell that to my bank account.
>
>Anyway, let's get started with this little ditty. Seems like our protagonist is feeling a little down and out, and
> they're looking for some comfort. Like, come on, who among us hasn't looked for someone to blame when things go wrong?
> And if that someone happens to be a significant other, well, it's just a bonus.
>
>But our protagonist seems to be getting some mixed signals. First, they offer this "one love, one life" mantra, which
> is all cool and romantic until it's revealed that the love is just for the night. Talk about false advertising. But
> hey,
> sharing is caring, right?
>
>As the song goes on, our protagonist starts questioning things. Did they disappoint their boo? Leave a bad taste in
> their mouth? Well, if that's their response, maybe our narrator should've just stayed home and watched Netflix. At
> least
> they know how to appreciate a good love story.
>
>And speaking of bad taste, it seems our protagonist's love interest has some issues. They act like they've never had
> love before and expect our narrator to just go without. Like, excuse me? Do I look like a charity case to you? I have
> feelings, too.
>
>But wait, it gets better (or worse, depending on how you look at it). It's too late tonight to discuss any of these
> issues because, you know, it's dark outside and nobody wants to deal with real problems in the dark. Plus, we're all
> just one but we're not the same. Which, in my humble opinion, is a good thing because I don't really want to carry
> anyone else's baggage.
>
>Then comes the chorus, which is pretty straightforward. Have you come here for forgiveness? Have you come to raise the
> dead? Have you come here to play Jesus to the lepers in your head? Uh, no thank you. I didn't sign up for a religious
> experience, I just wanted a good time.
>
>But of course, it wouldn't be a love song without some drama. Did our protagonist ask too much? Were their expectations
> too high? Well, if you gave them nothing, you can't really be surprised that it's all they have now.
>
>But hey, love is a temple, right? A higher law? Preach it, Bono. Except, our protagonist has some
